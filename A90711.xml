         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ay it pleaſe your Lordſhip to know, that this
Univerſitie is now in extream danger of the ſuffering all Evils and
Calamities, that warlike forces may may bring upon it. Such forces we hear for
certain are ſome of them already upon their March, ſome others in raiſing
to aſſault, and if they may have their wils (I mean the common ſort of
them) to ſpoil &amp; deſtroy us. My L. you have been ſollicitous, whom to
appoint your Vice-Chancellor over us for this next yeer. But if theſe forces
come forward, and doe that Execution upon us and this place, that we fear they
intend; there will be no uſe at all of any Vice-Chancellor. For what will be
here for him to do, where there will be no ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for him to govern? Or
what ſhould Schollers do here, having no Libraries left them to ſtudy in?
no Schools to diſpute in? Chappels to ſerve God in? Colleges or Halls to
live or lodge in? but have all theſe ranſacked, defaced, demoliſhed. So
that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156055:3"/>Poſteritie may
have to ſay, See here was for a long time, and till ſuch a yeere an
Univerſitie of great Renowne and Eminence, in all Manner of Learning and
Vertue. But now layd utterly waſte and buried in her own Ruines. And then
with the queſtion be; What had they then no L. Chancellour over them? Or was
He unable to protect them, either by His power, or by his mediation and favour
in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe! Or were men of place and Governours in the Univerſitie
ſo ſleepie and ſtupid, as not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his protection of them? Or was
he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with their danger, and regardleſſe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe of
what might befall them? We are all of us very confident, that if your
Lordſhip would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to interpoſe with your intreaties for us to the
Honourable Houſes of Parliament for our ſafetie and ſecuritie therein all
would be well with us, as now it is, the delinquents that were one while ſent
for are not one of them here at this time. Sir <hi>Iohn Byron</hi> with his
Regiment of Troopers (who have been 2 few dayes here without the leaſt
dammage or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that I know of any man) we ſhal (I doubt not) ſoon
prevaile withall to withdraw from us, if he may with his ſafetie return back
to His Majeſtie, who of His owne gracious Care of us ſent him hither; And
if your Lordſhip ſhall be ſecured, that no other forces ſhall be here
impoſed upon us, that will take the libertie to exerciſe that barbarous
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence with which the illiterate, rude, and ruffianly rabble of the
Vulgar threaten us. Againſt ſuch and againſt ſuch onely, our young men
have lately taken in hand the Arms: We have (a very few God knows, and in weake
hands enough) to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156055:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>and us
from having our Libraries fired, our Collages pillaged, and our throats cut by
them; if they ſhould ſuddainly break in upon us. And this (my Lord is all
the ſinfull intent we have had in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to train in a voluntarie
and peaceable manner ſo as they have done. Good my Lord, and that which I
moſt earneſtly beg of your Honour is out of the ſence and humble
Requeſt of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, vouchſafe to put in action with all
ſpeed, what you in your wiſdom conceive may be moſt effectuall and
prevalent with the Honourable Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, for the peace and
ſecuritie of this place, and for the ſtaying of our Students, a great part
of whom, (ſuch ſtout and hardy men they are) upon Alarmes and affrights,
ſuch as have been hourly here of late, are ſled away from us home to their
mothers. The diſciples then in danger of drowning clamored our Saviour with
Maſter careſt thou not that we periſh? But I am bold to aſſume for
your Honour and to aſſure all of this Univerſity under your happy
government, that you will not (ſo farre as in your power is) ſuffer any one
